# Inventory App

Simple inventory application built with Express and NodeJS as backend and MongoDB, deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app).
Check live site [here](https://inventory-app-production-6bc9.up.railway.app/)

The layout and css used are similar to LocalLibrary site from MDN Tutorial because on this project I focused myself solely on the backend and MongoDB, rather the frontend parts.  
I'm planning to build the actual fullstack project soon with MERN stack.
